# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

Here you can find my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree projects

[Project bike sharing](https://github.com/SebastianMuhle/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/blob/main/project-bikesharing/Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb): The first project uses a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership.

[Project dog classification](https://github.com/SebastianMuhle/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/main/project-dog-classification): This project is about building a dog classifier. First the classifier is build from scratch than a transfer learning approach is used.

[Project TV script generation](https://github.com/SebastianMuhle/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/blob/main/project-tv-script-generation/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb): The third project uses an RNN to generate a new TV script based on the popular TV show Seinfield.

[Project face generation](https://github.com/SebastianMuhle/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/blob/main/project-face-generation/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb): This project use a GAN to generate new celebrity faces.
